# Introduction

Welcome to the Alchemy developer documentation! On this page, you will find all of the information you need to integrate with Alchemy, including guides, API references, and more.

This documentation is open source. Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/alchemyrpg/slate/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug.md) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/alchemyrpg/slate/pulls) if you find any errors in the documentation or would like to add anything.

# Character Import

Alchemy Unlimited provides the ability to import NPCs into any universe that the user can edit. Today, this is a file-based import process, but we may open up an API for this in the future.

To import a single NPC, create a JSON file with a single [`Character`](#character) object in it. You can find more examples of single-character imports in the [alchemyrpg/5e-srd](https://github.com/alchemyrpg/5e-srd) repository.

The [`Character`](#character) object represents a player or non-player character on Alchemy.

When creating a character for 5e, note that SRD spells can simply be an object with the `name` property set to the name of the spell rather than a full [`Spell`](#spell) object. If the spell name matches an existing SRD spell (case-insensitive), it will be added to the character.

As with languages, you can customize a dragon's skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form.\n\nSpells. See the \"Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters\" inset(s), below.\n\nOther Traits and Actions. You can borrow traits and actions from other monsters to add unique flavor to a dragon. Consider these examples:\n\nFlyby, The dragon is an agile flier, quick to fly out of enemies' reach.\nThe dragon doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.\n\nMimicry. Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon.\nThe dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check.\n\nRejuvenation. You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery.\nIf it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the object.\n\nSpecial Senses. Most dragons have blindsight and darkvision. You might upgrade blindsight to truesight, or you could give a dragon with a burrowing speed tremorsense.",

The dragon's spell save DC is DC 16, and it has +8 to hit with spell attacks.\n   A suggested spell list is shown below, but you can also choose spells to reflect the dragon's character. A dragon who innately casts druid spells feels different from one who casts warlock spells. You can also give a dragon spells of a higher level than this rule allows, but such a tweak might increase the dragon's challenge rating—especially if those spells deal damage or impose conditions on targets.\n\n* invisibility\n\n* plant growth\n\n* speak with animals",
